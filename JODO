JODO - TODO list system based on my needs

Based on https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt

= Tools

t format (without [ox]) --- Add to TODO list

nt --- Show $TODO_SHOW items
Look at https://github.com/fniessink/next-action

ct format --- Completes the task specified by format
option to not repeat

at --- Archive done

= Environment
Use $TODO_PROJ and $TODO_CTXT to automatically add @CTXT and +PROJ to query

From $PWD, search outward for .todo.txt in directories to accumulate todos
Automatically use 'ag XXX' and 'ag TODO' to find more TODOs from $PWD

t adds to closest file unless -f is provided

ct complets from closest file and uses -f to add to same file

= Format

o or x -- Complete or not
datetime -- Completion date (optional)
datetime -- Start date (optional)
desc -- String (may include context or project)
tags

where

date := YYYY/MM/DD or YYYY-MM-DD
time := HH:mm
datetime := date@time or date
id := string without spaces
project := +id
context := @id
tags := listof tag
tag := id:string

Known tags:
due:datetime
id:id --- Name task
(p|before):id --- Parent / Happens before
after:id --- Happens after
x:file --- Command to execute to do the activity
f:file --- File where more information is contained
t:file --- File to log time to
r:repeat --- Repeat clause
rd:repeat --- Repeat just for due
rs:repeat --- Repeat just for start

repeat := 
 + -- next
++ -- since completion
 N -- how many
 u -- unit (_m_onth, _d_ay, _w_eek, _b_usiness day)
